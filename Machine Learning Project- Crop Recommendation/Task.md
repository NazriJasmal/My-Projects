The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning-based web application that provides recommendations for suitable crops that needed to be cultivated based on various environmental and soil conditions. 

It aims to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in making informed decisions about crop selection, to optimize the yields, minimize crop failure and maximizing profitability.

The system takes into account several factors such as soil factors (N, P, K), climate, rainfall, temperature, humidity, and pH levels to determine the most suitable crops for a region. By analyzing historical data and using predictive models, the system provides personalized recommendations tailored to the specific conditions of a farm or agricultural area.

Build a crop recommendation system using machine learning algorithms and integrated it into a web application using the Flask framework.

The system uses machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision trees, Random forests, K-Nearest Neighbor  and support vector machines to make predictions and recommend the best crop for the given input data.

 The project showcases the power of machine learning and how it can be used to solve real-world problems in the agricultural industry. The web application created using Flask allows farmers to easily input their data and get crop recommendations quickly and efficiently
