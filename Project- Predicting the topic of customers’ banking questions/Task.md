## Machine Learning Project - Predicting the topic of customers’ banking questions.
You are consulting for a bank (a commercial entity) on how to make their online customer service more effective. They want to trial an automated first level of filtering for questions asked by customers in an online chat. Specifically, they want to know whether it is possible to identify the topic a question relates to, for some specific topics of interest. You are provided with a dataset with sample questions and their associated topic.
They want you to use machine learning to predict the question topic in details (that is, whether a question is about “card queries or issues”, “needs troubleshooting”, “top up queries or issues” or “other” – 4 classes in total). The question topic is contained in the column titled “label”.
They want to compare traditional machine learning algorithms with neural networks to see if the latter offer significantly higher performance.
They want you to write the results of your analysis and implementation in a report.
