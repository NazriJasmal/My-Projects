# Project- Transport For London- Tube Network
Select a city with extensive public transport network. (Here I have used Transport for London Network). By utilising the Python programming language, represent part of the public transport network (e.g., bus, tubeâ€¦) of the selected city by using the graph data structure.

The implementation of the transport network is expected to consist of minimum 5 lines as edges, and minimum 5 stations on each line as nodes.

The network should be completely interconnected, ensuring that there are edges connecting every pair of nodes.

When visualising the network, use different colours for the different lines and their corresponding stations.

Set up and display attributes for the edges, which represent the distances between the stations. If precise station-to-station distances are unavailable, estimate them by leveraging online mapping services such as Google Maps.

Visualise the names of the lines and the stations on the generated map.
