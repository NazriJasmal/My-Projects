## Design and Implement Water Quality Data WareHouse

You are required to design and build a data mart/data warehouse preferably using the Oracle DBMS (Database Management System), implement required tasks. 

### Description of the Scenario 

Traditional water quality monitoring involves three steps, namely water sampling periodically, 
testing and investigation. This technique can be expensive, human centric, time consuming, and only 
provides data at the point of sampling. Water samples are taken back to the lab for analysis, or 
expensive handheld devices used in test locations, with each parameter requiring a specific sensor. 
Lab testing generates accurate spot pollutant measurements, but under normal circumstances, it is 
not economical for various locations all over the country. In some cases, trend of data or a close to 
accurate estimation of the future parameter values could be enough for businesses.

For customers the ability to remotely monitor data is the perfect solution, saving both time and 
money, as all they are interested in is the data, and not necessary how it is collected. Although in-
location sensors have a typical accuracy of 95% compared to lab results, this is acceptable as the 
customer now has real time data, trend analysis, and alerts enabling them to act much sooner than 
before. Multiple nodes can be deployed to build up an extensive picture of water quality. However, 
the in-location sensors (optical or Ionic) are expensive, require maintenance, and more importantly 
limited range of detectable pollutants. Customers are asking for pollutant measurement where there 
is no commercial sensor available, for instance water phosphates (organic, inorganic & total), or 
where sensors are expensive, Nitrate & Nitrite. In-location sensors are not suitable for long term 
deployment in water, some 6 weeks life before maintenance. Ionic sensors can be confused from 
other heavy ions in the water and provide false readings. 

To prepare the dataset, samples are taken at sampling points around England and can be from 
coastal or estuarine waters, rivers, lakes, ponds, canals or groundwaters. They are taken for a 
number of purposes including compliance assessment against discharge permits, investigation of 
pollution incidents or environmental monitoring. 

It has been decided to use the data from the Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs in 
the first instance. The Environment Agency use an online Data Service Platform to provide the water 
quality dataset to public. The Water Quality Archive provides data on water quality measurements. 
Samples are taken at sampling points around England and can be from coastal or estuarine waters, 
rivers, lakes, ponds, canals or groundwaters. They are taken for a number of purposes including 
compliance assessment against discharge permits, investigation of pollution incidents or 
environmental monitoring. The archive provides data on measurements and samples dating from 
2000. The data columns for the system are given below. The collected data from 2000 until 2016 can 
be found on the student portal or from your course coordinator for Data Warehousing COMP1848
under the name WaterQuality_CW.zip. There are many concerns about the quality of data in the 
database.

You should design the Data Warehouse which will provide information on the following:
• The list of water sensors measured by type of it by month
• The number of sensor measurements collected by type of sensor by week
• The number of measurements made by location by month
• The average number of measurements covered for PH by year
• The average value of Nitrate measurements by locations by year

#### Design Data Mart/Warehouse 
You should produce a star schema for your data mart design. 

#### ETL 
In the first instance you will need to export the data from a Microsoft Access database into Oracle. 
You should then create a staging area in your own area. The data should be cleansed, and any 
necessary transformations carried out. 

#### Data Cleansing 
You should plan your cleansing exercise by identifying the various types of error that you will search 
for (e.g. missing primary keys, missing foreign keys, misspellings, remove unnecessary records/
columns, impute missing values etc.) and describe the techniques which you used to find errors and 
cleanse the data. 

You should show how you have used SQL for both purposes. 

#### Building the Warehouse 

You should create and populate the fact and dimension tables for your star schema. 

The FACT table and the TIME table can be populated at the same time using a cursor. 

Write SQL queries on the star schema to provide the required statistical information. 

#### Establish connection between Oracle and Python and Extract information
You should create a mechanism to be able to establish a connection between Python and Oracle 
and populate required data from your star schema in Python. Establish data preparation (e.g., table 
selection, query results, connection string, etc.). Additional dataset can be provided upon request. 
The given source code must be error free. 

#### Deliverables 
Submit a report to support your implementation which should include: 
• Explain and justify every step of your DW design and implementation in the report.
• Your Star Schema Design and BUS plan.
• Documentation for your ETL processes to include all scripts.
• A data cleansing plan together with any scripts to identify and rectify errors.
• PL/SQL code listings for your system.
• Scripts for SQL for your queries.
• Your Data Warehouse BUS plan.
• Python code used for connecting to Oracle, data pre-processing, and result summary.
• A screenshot of any forms, reports, or other GUIs.
• A discussion of any problems that you encountered and how you tried to solve them.
• Submit a file of your scripts used to build and query the data warehouse.
